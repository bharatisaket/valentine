# 💘 The Love Eras Tour: A Swiftie Valentine's Proposal

A custom-built, interactive web experience designed to ask the ultimate question: *"Will you be my Valentine?"* Inspired by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, this project takes the user on a journey through three musical eras, featuring synced lyrics, interactive buttons, and a dynamic "Ticket" generation finale.

## ✨ Features

* **🎵 Era-Based Navigation:** Transitions seamlessly between *Reputation*, *Lover*, and *Midnights* aesthetics.
* **🎤 Perfectly Synced Lyrics:** Uses an internal LRC parser to sync lyrics to the millisecond with the audio.
* **🏃‍♂️ The "Runaway" Button:** The "No" button intelligently dodges the cursor using proximity detection math to ensure it never overlaps the "Yes" button.
* **🖱️ Custom Cursors:** Context-aware cursors (Sparkles default, Arrow Heart for "Yes", Broken Heart for "No").
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Optimized for both Desktop and Mobile views (Flexbox & CSS Gradients).
* **🎟️ Dynamic Ticket Generator:** Generates a personalized "Eras Tour" ticket upon acceptance.
